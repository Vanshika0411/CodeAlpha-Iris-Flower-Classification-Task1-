# CodeAlpha-Iris Flower Classification Task1
ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
This project is part of CodeAlpha's internship tasks, where we classify Iris flowers into three speciesâ€”Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginicaâ€”based on features like petal and sepal length and width.
It uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) to explore data and build a classification model.

Files included:

Iris.csv â€“ Dataset with labeled iris flower data

vanshika-jain-iris-dataset.ipynb â€“ Notebook containing code for analysis, model training, and evaluation

README.md â€“ Overview of the project
